In Pac-Man, players control a circular, yellow character named Pac-Man, navigating a maze filled with pellets while being pursued by colorful ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal is to eat all the pellets while avoiding the ghosts. Power pellets temporarily turn the tables, allowing Pac-Man to chase and eat the ghosts for bonus points. The game's simple yet addictive gameplay and distinctive characters have made it a cultural phenomenon, influencing popular culture and video game design for decades.
